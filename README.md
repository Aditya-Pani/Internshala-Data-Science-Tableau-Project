# 📊 The Bike Haven - Sales Dashboard (Tableau Project)

🚴‍♂️ Project Overview
This Tableau project was developed as part of the Data Science Post Graduate Course by Internshala Trainings. The goal was to transform static sales reports into an interactive, insightful dashboard for The Bike Haven, a bicycle retail shop based in San Francisco.

The dashboard is designed for Chris, the Sales Manager, to make data-driven decisions and monitor sales performance across products, customers, and geographies.

📝 Problem Statement
Create a visually interactive and informative dashboard for The Bike Haven using Tableau. The dashboard must allow tracking of sales data by product, customer, geography, and timeline while enabling comparison with budgeted sales figures.

📂 Data Sources
PostgreSQL Database (7 tables: customer, sales, date, product, category, subcategory, geography)

budgets.csv for monthly sales targets

Data preprocessing was done using SQL (joins, filters, and column pruning). The final dataset was exported to CSV and visualized in Tableau.

📈 Dashboard Features
The final dashboard includes:

1) Top 10 Products by Sales Amount

2) Top 10 Customers

3) Sales Figures vs. Budget (Monthly)

4) Sales by Region/Country (with map view)

5) Sales by Product Category

6) Customer Commute Distance Distribution

7) Sales by Year (2021–2023)

8) Gender-wise Customer Distribution

9) Country-wise Sales & Category Split

💡 Dashboard Highlights
Built in A4 Portrait Format as required

Fully interactive with filters for:

1) Country

2) Product Category

3) Customer

Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing
